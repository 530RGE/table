Table component built in svelte based on shadcn-svelte components.

Table component for easy display of tables based on remote data (planned support for client-side functionality).

## For whom?
You copy the [component](https://github.com/tzezar/table/tree/main/src/lib/components/table) directly into your project and can edit it as you wish. It is something between a ready-made data-grid and a headless table.
